# Home Manager

This is my _(in progress)_ work of having a flake-based, standalone, home-manager installation that will manage the 
_ubiquitous_ tools and applications I use as well as my dotfiles.

My intent is to use something like [the nix way dev templates](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates) for
_per project_ tools and dependencies.

## Todos for Home Manager

- learn nushell and then switch _from_ **zsh** _to_ **nushell**
- finish customizing my `git config` and `git-related` files
- figure out how to have new `*.desktop` files be discovered by GNOME, without having to logout and log back in after installing them
- ideally find more flake-based resources for developer environments
- learn HM better and see what services I can set up via HM as well
